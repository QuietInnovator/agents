I’m Chadi, a software engineer turned data scientist, and I’m here to
get you results.
That's what I do. it's I’ve done in the past, and it’s what I’ll keep
doing.
I've led and collaborated through the entire lifecycle of a data
science project, where I executed tasks and communicated results
effectively.
While doing my master's, I worked at Sanofi and Student World.
These fast-paced environments required quick data solutions. So
in the past year, I delivered on efficient ETL, GenAI, and advanced
analytics.
- At Sanofi, a major pharmaceutical, I led the development of a data
driven process that saved over 40 hours per month.
- While at Student World, a Student Consultancy firm, I built a genAI
solution for internal use, and savied the admissions team 100 hours
a month of research.
- And for my master’s project, I worked in a group to develop
an advanced analytics model for forecasting energy demand in
Australia. My role involved data wrangling and scraping over 30,000
Excel files. Our model outperformed existing ones and earned a high
distinction.
All of those projects used different technologies, but what they all
needed was precision, speed, and strategic thinking. That’s where I
shine.
Now enough about me, let's have a chat!
